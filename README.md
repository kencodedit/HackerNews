# HackerNews
#### This is a Frontend React project.
In this project, i use an external API called hackerNews (algolia) API to fetch stories which reference the input in the search box. 
The application allows you to remove stories you are not very interested in and read more about stories you are interested in. 
You also have pagination and can click “next” to fetch more stories. 

The search input box allows you to input any topic you are interested in reading about. 
This project also utilizes CSS variables and ContextAPI and Reducers.
